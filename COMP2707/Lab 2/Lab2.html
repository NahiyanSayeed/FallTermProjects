                <p>
                    Hey, I'm Spondon/SinonSpn (The one in blue).<br /> I am a 3rd-year Computer Science student. <br>
                    I'm currently studying at the University of Windsor. <br />

                <p>
                    I am a programmer, musician, and gamer who also enjoys anime.
                    I have studied and played music for over a decade, specializing in both the flute and oboe.
                    As a dedicated gamer, I've invested countless hours into playing Final Fantasy 14, which happens to
                    be my all-time favorite game.
                    At one point, I achieved the impressive rank of 10 globally as a bard under the username SinonSpn.
                    If you're interested in checking out my gaming achievements, here's the

                    <!-- also there to show that i was in fact ranked 10th globally for that patch-->
                    In addition to my other interests, I used to be a Taekwondo martial artist and achieved a belt
                    rating of red stripe, which is only 3 ranks below the coveted black belt.
                    Here are some photos from my last tournament

                    Before you continue scrolling to the skills tab, I'd like to share a remarkable moment from my
                    adventures in Final Fantasy. <a
                        href="https://clips.twitch.tv/BusyArborealSandstormSaltBae-ANslvOVA6lQB32to"
                        target="_blank">[Click here]</a> to watch the clip.

                    In this video, you'll see me in action, sprinting across the arena towards the red circle on the
                    right. In my hands, I hold a massive area-of-effect bomb, a crucial item that only one other player
                    can handle. With impeccable timing and teamwork, not only do I reach the designated spot just in the
                    nick of time, but I also ensure that the other player can join me in soaking the deadly
                    area-of-effect damage. This split-second decision saved our team from an instant wipe, allowing us
                    to continue our challenging boss battle. It's moments like these that make gaming experiences truly
                    memorable.
